# Final results

Question: How has the geographic distribution of Nobel laureates changed over time? Are certain contries/continents overrepresented?

## Distribution of the continents

A closer look at this distribution of Nobel laureates reveals a geographical imbalance. Nearly half (48%) are based in Europe, while 43% are located in North America. This means that a astounding 91% of all Nobel Prize winners come from just these two regions, leaving only 9% to represent the rest of the world combined.
 
## Distribution of the generations and continents in time

By looking at the distribution that combines both the continents and different periods it is very noticable that in the 50 years period from 1901-1950 there is significant increase in the number of nobel laureates in Europe and North America and slight increase in the numebr of nobel laureates in Asia

We are observing the 25-years periods from 1876-2000.
* Europe (1876-1900) :  value above avarage, most laureates were European in the ealy period probably because the Nobel Prize started in Europe.
* North America (1876-1900): value much lower than average in that early period, possibly because the Nobel Prize was new and most laureates were European.
* North America (1926–1950): This was a strong period for North America in terms of Nobel achievements
* Asia (1951–1975) : Asia saw a significant rise in Nobel laureates during this mid-20th century period.

## Results:
Europe dominated in the early years (especially 1876–1900) and overall has had a consistently high number of Nobel laureates. North America became strong in the mid-20th century and Asia jumped up post WWII, espcially in the 1951-1975 period. Africa, Oceania and South America had relativly fewer Nobel laureates across most periods. The 1976-2000 period shows fewer results because the Nobel Prize data for recent decades may still be incomplete.
