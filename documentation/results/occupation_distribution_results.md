# Distribution of the disciplines in relation to the geographical origin of the Nobel laureates 
**Research question** : Is there a relationship between a laureateâ€™s geographical origin and their chosen discipline?

## Distribution of the disciplines across continents

Among all possible disciplines, physics and biochemistry appeared as the most dominant and were selected for this analysis. The distribution of these disciplines across continents reveals that Europe has the highest representation, followed by North America. The remaining regions account for a significantly smaller proportion.

* Biochemistry: North America stands out and  far more biochemists than average come from the U.S./Canada. Every other continent is below the global baseline, indicating under-representation.
* Other disciplines (all prizes outside biochemistry and physics): North America is strongly under-represented, while every other continent shows a slight positive value indicating a slight over-representation. Africa, Oceania and South America punch above their weight compared to the baseline.
* Physics discipline: all values hover near zero, there is a  much more even, global distribution of physics Nobel winners.

## Results
* Biochemistry is is hugely concentrated in North America.
* Physics is the most evenly distributed discipline.
* Other disciplines favor Europe, Oceania, South America and Africa over North America.
