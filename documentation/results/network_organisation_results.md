**Research Question**: Do specific universities or other institutions increase the likelihood of winning a Nobel Prize? Have these institutions produced multiple Nobel laureate over time?

* Columbia University: highest betweenness but low eigenvector - although it is not deeply in the core network it connect many otherwise‐separate institutions.
* Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin: highest eigenvector but low betweenness - it sits at the heart of the most interconnected community but isn’t itself a major bridge between different institutions.
* Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München: ranks very high on both measures - it is both very influential and a bridge between institutions.
* University of Freiburg: moderate eigenvector but high betweenness - a smaller group (8 members) that nonetheless plays a critical bridge role.
* University of Göttingen and University of Cambridge: high eigenvector and moderate betweenness - infiential institution that also connects with other institutions.
