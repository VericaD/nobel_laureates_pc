## Problem statement
By adopting an exploratory approach, this study aims to propose a model of the scientific field of Nobel laureates (inspired by Pierre Bourdieu’s notion of field)—that is, a simplified representation of the structure of disciplinary (or more broadly, social) domains and their evolution over time. We will examine the socio-demographic profiles and intellectual positions of these actors, their institutional affiliations, and the resulting networks of relationships among individuals and organizations. Additionally, we will develop a model to trace the evolution of this structure across different periods. As part of a prosopographical approach, we will systematically collect data on the actors’ characteristics to identify recurring biographical and professional profiles.

## Research questions
* Is there a correlation between a laureate's socio-demographic factors and their discipline?
* How has the geographic distribution of Nobel laureates changed over time? Are certain contries overrepresented?
* Do specific universities or other institutions increase the likelihood of winning a Nobel Prize? Have these institutions produced multiple Nobel laureate over time?
* Do Nobel laureates follow distinct career trajectories and are there common patterns in their professional developement?
* How do socio-demographic factors or other personal aspects influence the topics of the Nobel winning research?
* Does winning a Nobel prize inspire further significant contributions to the field?

## Aspects of the information to be collected
* Geographical origins of the laureates
* Gender
* Educational background
* Career trajectory 
* Significant publications and collaboration
* Post-Nobel contributions
